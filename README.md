### OBJECTIVE

To provide a seamless and secure e-commerce platform for purchasing electric vehicle accessories, featuring an intuitive user interface, live order tracking, and reliable payment processing.

### INTRODUCTION

EVolution is a modern e-commerce platform designed specifically for purchasing electric vehicle (EV) accessories. Built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it offers a seamless and secure shopping experience for EV enthusiasts. The platform features a visually appealing, user-friendly interface and a robust backend powered by a comprehensive REST API.

The REST API facilitates smooth communication between the frontend and backend, supporting endpoints for user authentication, product management, order handling, and payment processing. Key features include live order tracking, secure JWT-based authentication, and Stripe payment integration for reliable transactions. Administrators benefit from a dedicated admin panel with full CRUD operations to manage products, inventory, and orders effortlessly.

By leveraging the scalability and flexibility of the MERN stack alongside the REST API, EVolution addresses the growing needs of the EV market, delivering an innovative, full-stack solution for buyers and administrators. Hosted on Render, it ensures high performance and reliability for an enhanced EV accessory purchasing journey.
